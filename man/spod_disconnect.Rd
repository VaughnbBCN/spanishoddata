\title{Safely disconnect from data and free memory}
\usage{
spod_disconnect(tbl_con, free_mem = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{tbl_con}{A \code{tbl_duckdb_connection} connection object that you get from either \code{spod_get()} or \code{spod_connect()}.}

\item{free_mem}{A \code{logical}. Whether to free up memory by running \code{gc()}. Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
No return value, called for side effect of disconnecting from the database and freeing up memory.
}
\description{
This function is to ensure that \code{DuckDB} connections to CSV.gz files (created via \code{spod_get()}), as well as to \code{DuckDB} files or folders of \code{parquet} files (created via \code{spod_convert()}) are closed properly to prevent conflicting connections. Essentially this is just a wrapper around \code{DBI::dbDisconnect()} that reaches out into the \code{.$src$con} object of the \code{tbl_duckdb_connection} connection object that is returned to the user via \code{spod_get()} and \code{spod_connect()}. After disonnecting the database, it also frees up memory by running \code{gc()}.

od_distr <- spod_get("od", zones = "distr", dates <- c("2020-01-01", "2020-01-02"))
